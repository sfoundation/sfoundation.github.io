&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare facilities in the state still needs a lot of improvement. Through our tie up with one of the best teaching hospitals of the state i.e. IMS &amp;amp; SUM Hospital, we have decided to provide specialized healthcare to the residents of Champati and surrounding villages. Doctors from specialized and super specialized wings like Medicine, Opthalmology, Paediatrics, Pulmonary Medicine&amp;lt; Neurology, Gastroenterology, Oncology etc shall camp at the foundation office at regular intervals and provide free check up facility and medicines to the patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://savitreefoundation.org/posts/health2015/&#34;&gt;mega health camp&lt;/a&gt;, which helped us assess the medical requirements of the residents of the area. The specialist doctor visits are planned accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
