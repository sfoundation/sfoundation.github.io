      <title>Healthcare Program</title>
      <link>http://savitreefoundation.org/posts/healthcare/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The details for the &lt;strong&gt;healthcare&lt;/strong&gt; program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare facilities in the state still needs a lot of improvement. Through our tie up with one of the best teaching hospitals of the state i.e. IMS &amp;amp; SUM Hospital, we have decided to provide specialized healthcare to the residents of Champati and surrounding villages. Doctors from specialized and super specialized wings like Medicine, Opthalmology, Paediatrics, Pulmonary Medicine&amp;lt; Neurology, Gastroenterology, Oncology etc shall camp at the foundation office at regular intervals and provide free check up facility and medicines to the patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted a &lt;a href=&#34;http://savitreefoundation.org/posts/health2015/&#34;&gt;mega health camp&lt;/a&gt;, which helped us assess the medical requirements of the residents of the area. The specialist doctor visits are planned accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Each One Teach One Program</title>
      <link>http://savitreefoundation.org/posts/each-one-teach-one/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The details for the &lt;strong&gt;Each-One-Teach-One&lt;/strong&gt; program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, education in the rural areas is completely Government supported. Thus, students tend to drop out of school as soon as the extent of the support decreases. Moreover, not all schools in the rural areas are equipped with the necessary resources to provide a basic standard of education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous intelligent students, who despite their intelligence lack formal education due to various personal factors. These students aren&amp;rsquo;t provided with a proper vision to employ their intelligence and education to shape a prosperous future for themselves and their family. We aim to identify such students through an innovatively devised &lt;strong&gt;IQ test&lt;/strong&gt;, adapted from the renowned Cambridge Self-Scoring IQ Test. We have created a &lt;a href=&#34;http://savitreefoundation.org/pdf/book.pdf&#34;&gt;booklet&lt;/a&gt; for the same (in Odia) with the hope that it will act as a guide for other similar endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year from 2015 onwards, bright students from &lt;strong&gt;economically backward&lt;/strong&gt; families are being selected on the basis of their performance in this &lt;strong&gt;unique IQ test&lt;/strong&gt; devised and performed by certified clinical psychologists. The foundation will enroll them in the best available local school and bear their entire educational expenditure, including special coaching, travel etc. till they find their own feet in the society. The only condition that the foundation imposes on the students is that they support one or more students through this program once they have established themselves, leading to the self-sustainability of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also hope to kindle similar programs in other parts of Odisha with like minded individuals/groups with the endeavor of providing a platform for such deserving students to make their way up in the society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Krushi Vikas program</title>
      <link>http://savitreefoundation.org/posts/krushi-vikas/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The details for the &lt;strong&gt;Krushi-Vikas&lt;/strong&gt; program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agriculture is not profitable&lt;/em&gt; is a general consensus amongst most modern day farmers. We believe that such a notion exists because of the unscientific practices which they follow. In the champati area, we observed that farmers usually grow two crops a year: rice followed by sowing of green gram as the rain-fed crop without proper management practices. Majority areas were cultivated by tenant farmers while the total crop yield wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough for their livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of scientists, from Sikha &amp;lsquo;O&amp;rsquo; Anusandhan University, visited the village and opined that a shorter duration (120 days instead of 145 days) rice, followed by vegetable cultivation (winter and summer) would be highly profitable if proper scientific methods were to be followed. They agreed to provide the requisite input through continuous visits and evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an experimental basis, we motivated few farmers in the village to adopt the proposed methods and provided them better lift-irrigation facilities and agriculture implements. The paddy crop raised in this experiment yielded &lt;a href=&#34;http://savitreefoundation.org/posts/recordagriculture2016&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;highest ever output&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (58.6 Quintal/hectare) in the area. On the back of this achievement, many farmers have now come forward to join the movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
